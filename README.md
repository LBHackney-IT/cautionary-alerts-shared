### Automated Versioning
The pipeline automatically updates the package version number.

Any specific version number follows the form `Major.Minor.Patch[-Suffix]`, where the components have the following meanings:

* *Major*: Breaking changes
* *Minor*: New features, but backward compatible
* *Patch*: Backwards compatible bug fixes only
* *Suffix (optional)*: a hyphen followed by a string denoting a pre-release version

## Branching Strategy

In order for the pipeline to be able to run automated tests and create preview versions of packages, you must name your branch correctly.

**Name your branch following the convention of `feature/<some-feature>`.** This will allow the pipeline to work correctly. 
If all tests pass, a new version of your package will be publised on every commit. You can see published versions of packages [here](https://github.com/orgs/LBHackney-IT/packages?repo_name=cautionary-alerts-shared).

All preview versions of packages will have the suffix **`-feat-<branch-name>-<number>`**
